I am an M.S. student in Biostatistics at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor as well as a Senior Systems Software Engineer in High-Performance Computing at Wayne State University. Previously, I completed a B.S. in Mathematics and an M.A. in Applied Mathematics under the direction of [Andrew Salch](https://s.wayne.edu/asalch/) at Wayne State University. Broadly, I am interested in developing mathematical and statistical tools to better understand complex biological problems arising from areas such as genetics and neuroscience.
